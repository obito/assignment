# Pipecat vs LiveKit: Real-World Voice AI Platform Comparison

## The Bottom Line First

**Use LiveKit if:** You want something that just works, scales easily, and you don't mind paying for the convenience. It's like choosing AWS over building your own infrastructure.

**Use Pipecat if:** You're optimizing for cost, need complete control, or you're building something that doesn't fit the standard patterns. It's more work but gives you superpowers.

I would say that Pipecat asks way more effort to have your first architecture out of the door, then you are good to go. 

LiveKit takes maybe 1-2 hours to understand how the whole ecosystem works and get to your first working call. Their SIP integration is very easy, and monitoring is built-in. 

However, I think the bill can go way out of hands easily on LiveKit, but at the same time, it doesn't ask you to be an expert on WebRTC, audio processing & real-time architecture to get a POC going.

From the tests that I did, PipeCat seems to be faster, if you know how to work with it (you can achieve around 300-400ms). LiveKit is good enough out of the box (600-700ms out of the box).

My take after working with both in around 24 hours: make your product validation with LiveKit, you can get a real system out in less than a week with everything built-in, even less if you know what you are doing and come with a background.

Then, you could tell yourself "I would like my hands-on X", and realize that on Pipecat, you can handle everything yourself, with more flexibility than LiveKit.

But I believe they can be used together. You can have some parts of your infrastructure running PipeCat pieces, and others LiveKit.

Again BOTH can be self-hosted, but some features of LiveKit will be ONLY availaible on their cloud infrastructure, like the noise cancellation.
